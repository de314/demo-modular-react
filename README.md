# Demo Modular React

I did the thing from (this awesome article)[https://scotch.io/tutorials/lazy-loading-routes-in-react].
You can see the (live demo)[https://de314.github.io/demo-modular-react/] thanks to Github Pages

### How It Works

There is a lot of extra stuff going on in the demo app. I am using
(recompose)[https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md] for HOC's and
(Redux)[https://redux.js.org/] for state management.
